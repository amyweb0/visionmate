Project Name
VISIONMATE


A REAL TIME ASSISTANT FOR THE VISUAL IMPAIRMENT..


The problem it solves-
DESCRIBE WHAT CAN PEOPLE USE IT FOR, OR HOW IT MAKES EXISTING TASKS EASIER/SAFER E.T.C
People with visual disabilities suffer a lot in current time.
As we see ourselves as prime example in it, we need to use spectacles or contact lenses to increase our visual powers but there is not any effective solution for visually impaired people.
They have to be accompanied by someone as a guide or they have to use a stick which helps them to walk alone. However, the stick has unavoidable drawbacks due to our rough terrain.

Challenges we ran into
TELL US ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC BUG OR HURDLE YOU RAN INTO WHILE BUILDING THIS PROJECT. HOW DID YOU GET OVER IT?
Making it more Affordable and Effective for visually impaired people.
By the help of arduino uno board we tried to make it affordable as the nano board is costly as comapred to it . we tried to reduce the unneccesary equipments that can cause errors and make the user unhappy.
Altering the range of the sensor according to the need of the user.
We tried to alter the range of ultrasonic sensor according to the user and make it highly user friendly

implementing the project in the real world scenarios
it was a challange to implement our imagination ,innovation and ideas in the real world. But we implemented it on a cap and made effective arrangement of the equipments so that the user seems comfortable with it.

Technologies we used - C, IOT, ADRUINO UNO, Ultrasonics Sensor HCSR-04
